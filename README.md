ADTF_ROS
========

This package holds an ADTF-to-ROS bridge consisting of different ADTF-filters that either translate ADTF pins to ROS topics or ROS topics to ADTF pins.
They are mainly used to connect the hardware interface of the small-scale cars of the Audi Autonomous Driving Cup to the Open Autonomous Driving package (oadrive) via ros_oadrive. 
The hardware interface of the small-scale vehicles is implemented in the proprietary framework ADTF and is not allowed to be exchanged during the competition.
